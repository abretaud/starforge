Originally Galaxy docker-build and later renamed Starforge, but as a collection
of disjointed shell scripts, Python, and YAML used to build Galaxy Tool Shed
dependencies, as well as rebuilding Debian and Ubuntu source packages with
modifications (which itself came from a project created to do the same via
Vagrant and Ansible called vadebuildsible).
